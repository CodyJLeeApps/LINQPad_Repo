# LINQPad_Repo
## Purpose: 
This repository is used to house LINQPad queries that need to be shared across machines.

## Sub-Suites
The suites found in this repo will consist of the following:

1. General Query Files - These files will be used as scratchpads, but they have a general theme.
2. Kata folders - These folders will house additional query files that will generally be used while running through Katas.
3. Course folders - These folders will be used to follow along in courses, and will be organized with the same structure that the videos of the course follow.
